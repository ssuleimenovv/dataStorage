## 🚀 What I Did Technically

- Developed SQL queries for data analysis tasks
- Created Python scripts for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Jupyter Notebooks
- Visualized data with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Worked with various CSV datasets (Netflix, FIFA, video game sales, etc.)
- Wrote PostgreSQL SQL scripts for solving database-related problems
- Applied basic data science techniques to real-world datasets
